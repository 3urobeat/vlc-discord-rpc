This is a modified version of the Pigpog/vlc-discord-rpc project, which is no longer being actively maintained. We have updated and enhanced the project by adding new features, such as album and show covers. 

To use this version, you will need to provide your Discord Application ID and Spotify API key, as well as fill out other necessary fields in the `./Storage/config.js` file. Once these credentials are added, you can run `npm i` followed by `node .` to launch VLC with the updated features.
