This is a rework of the project Pigpog/vlc-discord-rpc. Since the project has been maked readonly and is no longer receiving updates, we decided to update it and add more features! For now, you will still need a Discord Application ID and (currently) a LastFM api key. You can add these to the ./Storage/config.js file and run npm i followed by node . and it will automatically launch VLC.
