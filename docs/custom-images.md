# Custom Images
## URL Method
If you would like to change the default icons for pause, play, or VLC in your discord status, you will need to have a link to an image (which must end in .png, .jpg, or something similar). You can do this by using imgur, or any site of your choosing. Then, simply replace the link in the iconNames part of the config.js.

## File method
To use an uploaded file instead of a link you need to do the following:
1. Sign in to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Go to your application you created during setup.
3. On the left sidebar, click Rich Presence.
4. You should be under the Art Assets section, but if not click the Art Assets button.
5. Add your images, and choose names for them.
6. Go into your config.js, and under the iconNames section, set the icon to the name you choose for your image.
7. Give it a minute or two, and then you should see it working. For other users, it may take a few hours for your images to show up.
